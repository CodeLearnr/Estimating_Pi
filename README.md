# Estimating_Pi
The value of Pi can be calculated using the infinite series: 𝜋4=1−13+15−17+19… Write a program that estimates the value of Pi by calculating a user-specified number of terms of the equation above. For example, if the user enters the number 3, your program will estimate  as: 𝜋4=1−13+15   

Bonus: How many terms does it take for the calculation to stabilize using a double? In other words, how many terms need to be calculated before two consecutive results are the same due to the precision of a double?
