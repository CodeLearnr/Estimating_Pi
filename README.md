# Estimating_Pi
The value of  can be calculated using the infinite series: 𝜋4=1−13+15−17+19… Write a program that estimates the value of  by calculating a user-specified number of terms of the equation above. For example, if the user enters the number 3, your program will estimate  as: 𝜋4=1−13+15   Please check the formula in the following link:  https://d2l.bowvalleycollege.ca/d2l/le/content/285222/viewContent/4325140/View Bonus: How many terms does it take for the calculation to stabilize using a double? In other words, how many terms need to be calculated before two consecutive results are the same due to the precision of a double?
