# Estimating_Pi
The value of Pi can be calculated using the infinite series: 𝜋/4=1−1/3+1/5−1/7+1/9… Write a program that estimates the value of Pi by calculating a user-specified number of terms of the equation above. For example, if the user enters the number 3, your program will estimate Pi as: 𝜋/4=1−1/3+1/5   

Bonus: How many terms does it take for the calculation to stabilize using a double? In other words, how many terms need to be calculated before two consecutive results are the same due to the precision of a double?
